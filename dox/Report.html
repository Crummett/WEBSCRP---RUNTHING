Tasks were dragged out considerably longer than they ever should have taken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>A not insignificant problem was marrying up what we were learning at the given moment, with what I was attempting to do at the time. By the time I was trying to get into using php on my website, we were only just learning the basics, and were yet to touch on pdo. Similarly I failed to understand the api and its importance until quite late on, leading it to become fairly rushed. I found it very difficult to get to grips with the many different layers to web development and its lack of rigid structure. I found myself losing track of where bits of data were coming from and going to. During the course of the year I did start to get to grips with the structure, but transitioning to Node finally sent me down the right path, and development began in earnest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>When we learnt about Node.js in lectures, I was taken aback by how simple it was compared to using the many layers required for server-side php. Eventually I took the decision to re-do everything I had so far in Node, and continue from there. Naturally this caused a hold-up as I had to re-work all of my HTML as ejs templates, and convert my php into client-side JavaScript, however development was considerably faster once I had done this. The JavaScript element of web design has been what I&rsquo;ve found easiest. It ties in more naturally with the other programming experience I have from other units. The data manipulation was tricky, but I was able to fall back on phpMyAdmin in XAMPP to generate my queries. The visual elements (HTML and CSS) were also stumbling blocks. Trying to articulate what I&rsquo;m after in terms of layout and design has always felt hard within the confines of programming languages, and a lot of time was spent attempting to get things to line up just right, or have exactly the right coloured borders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Getting to grips with Node was also aided by the wealth of online resources for JavaScript. When dealing with php, I had struggled to find online answers for many of my questions, but with node I always managed to find a tutorial or stackoverflow question that could nudge me in the correct direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The order with which I approached things also changed dramatically. The event pages became my initial focus, essentially as a proof of concept as I worked out what was going on. Once I had transitioned to Node this was again my approach, to get events, with all of the get and post that entails, before applying what I&rsquo;d learned from that to creating the club and user pages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Ultimately my struggles with this unit came from a lack of structure all round. Using Node eased the burden, but this was a unit I undoubtedly found very hard. The scale of the coursework felt very daunting - coming up with the concept alone took a lot of thought - and this caused a fair amount of anxiety about where I was going. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll learn from this.</span></p></body></html>
